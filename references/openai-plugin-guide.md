# Custom OpenAI Plugin for ElizaOS

This is a custom OpenAI plugin for ElizaOS that fixes the 404 error issue with the official plugin. The official `@elizaos/plugin-openai` was calling a non-existent `/v1/responses` endpoint, which caused 404 errors. This custom plugin directly calls the standard `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Fixes 404 errors with OpenAI API calls
- ‚úÖ Direct integration with `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- ‚úÖ Supports all major OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenAI, iFlow, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Full compatibility with ElizaOS framework
- ‚úÖ Git-friendly - all code is tracked and versioned

## Installation

The custom plugin is automatically loaded when you have `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment variables.

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://apis.iflow.cn/v1  # or your OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL=qwen3-coder-plus
OPENAI_LARGE_MODEL=qwen3-coder-plus
```

## Supported Models

- `TEXT_SMALL` - For smaller, faster responses
- `TEXT_LARGE` - For more complex, detailed responses
- `OBJECT_SMALL` - For JSON object generation (small)
- `OBJECT_LARGE` - For JSON object generation (large)
- `TEXT_EMBEDDING` - For text embeddings

## How It Works

This plugin replaces the official `@elizaos/plugin-openai` with a custom implementation that:

1. Directly calls the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint instead of `/v1/responses`
2. Properly formats requests for OpenAI-compatible APIs
3. Handles errors and usage tracking correctly
4. Maintains full compatibility with the ElizaOS plugin system

## Benefits Over Official Plugin

- üöÄ Eliminates 404 errors
- ‚ö° Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary retries
- üõ°Ô∏è Better error handling
- üì¶ Git-friendly - all changes are tracked
- üîß Easier to customize and extend
